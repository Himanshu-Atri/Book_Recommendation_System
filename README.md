# Book_Recommendation_System
I built a book recommendation system using popularity and collaborative filtering, integrated into a Flask web app. The app shows the top 50 popular books and provides top 4 suggestions based on user input.

1. Clone this repository.
2. unzip the [model](https://github.com/Himanshu-Atri/Book_Recommendation_System/blob/main/model.zip) file.
3. Run the [app.py](https://github.com/Himanshu-Atri/Book_Recommendation_System/blob/main/app.py) file.
4. you can see the top 50 books on the home page.
5. Click on Recommend button in the nav bar.
6. enter your favourite book's name.
7. View results.

## To Run this Model yourself:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Extract the dataset from [data](https://github.com/Himanshu-Atri/Book_Recommendation_System/blob/main/data.zip).
3. Open the [Model Notebook](https://github.com/Himanshu-Atri/Book_Recommendation_System/blob/main/book_recommendation_system.ipynb).
4. Run this notebook.
5. create a model folder and add all the 3 pkl file to model folder.
6. you can either run the top_4_similar_books function or the app.py.
7. enter your favourite book's name.
8. View results.
